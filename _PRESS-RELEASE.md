There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Perfect your Pair
## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. Perfect Your Pair allows all Hack Reactor students to find and match with the best pair possible for pair programming sprints.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Perfect Your Pair is a web application where users scroll through a vertical feed that consists of 
  the profiles of other students in their Hack Reactor Cohort! Each profile contains a bio that has details on skills, interests, and programming type(conjurer or scribe). If a User sees a profile they enjoy, they can like the profile, and if the feeling is mutual, the people will be matched and have access to the same chat where they can plan their next sprint!

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  People hate having to search for a partner for a sprint right as everyone else is starting to work on theirs. Even worse, people often have horrible pairs which can last up to four days!

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Perfect Your Pair allows users to forgoe the hassel of searching for a partner at the closing bell, while giving users the ability to see what their possible pair is really like, before diving into code with them.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Try Perfect Your Pair, you won't regret it."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Simply go to LocalHost2000, enter your name, and get started!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I though I would be stuck in pairing partner hell, then I used Perfect Your Pair and everything changed."
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Head over to LocalHost2000 and see the difference we can really make!
